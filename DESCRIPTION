Title: Gene set enrichment analysis of different cell types using CELLEX values
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mads
Description: Takes as input a gene set (in ENSEMBL, UNIPROT, or HNGC format) and performs enrichment analysis / gene specificity analysis and outputs a dataframe with p-values and/or scores indicating how specifically expressed the gene set is in different cell types. The p-values are calculated by comparing the CELLEX values for the input gene set to the CELLEX values for the background gene set.
